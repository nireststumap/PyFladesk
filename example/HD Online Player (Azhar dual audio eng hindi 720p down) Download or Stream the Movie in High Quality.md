- The film was originally titled Mohammad Azharuddin, but was later changed to Azhar to avoid legal issues with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which had banned Azhar from playing cricket for life in 2000.

- The film features several real-life footage of Azharuddin's cricket matches, interviews, and press conferences. Some of the actors who played the roles of other cricketers also resembled their real-life counterparts, such as Gautam Gulati as Ravi Shastri and Manjot Singh as Navjot Singh Sidhu.
- The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the film for its performances, music, and direction, while others criticized it for its lack of authenticity, accuracy, and depth.
