# How to Use the Petroleum Measurement Tables (ASTM D 1250).pdf for Calculating Quantities of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products
  
The Petroleum Measurement Tables (ASTM D 1250).pdf are a set of standardized tables that provide conversion factors for calculating quantities of crude oil and petroleum products at reference conditions in different systems of measurement. They are based on the API MPMS Chapter 11.1 â 2004/Adjunct to IP 200/04/Adjunct to ASTM D 1250 â 04 (ADJD1250CD), which is a major revision of the previous versions of the tables[^1^] [^2^].

The tables cover a wide range of densities, temperatures, pressures, and volume correction factors for various types of petroleum fluids, such as crude oils, refined products, and lubricating oils. They are intended for use with single-phase liquids that are stable under normal operating conditions[^2^]. The tables are divided into three main sections: Generalized Crude Oils, Generalized Products, and Generalized Lubricating Oils. Each section has sub-sections for different systems of measurement: U.S. customary units, metric units, or both[^2^].
  
To use the tables, you need to know the density and temperature of the liquid at the observed conditions, as well as the reference temperature for the system of measurement you are using. You can measure the density using a hydrometer or a densitometer, but you need to apply appropriate corrections for thermal expansion and instrument calibration[^2^]. You can also use empirical correlations or laboratory analysis to estimate the density of some liquids[^2^].
  
Once you have the density and temperature at the observed conditions, you can use the tables to find the corresponding volume correction factor (VCF), which is the ratio of the volume at reference conditions to the volume at observed conditions. The VCF depends on the type and group of the liquid, as well as the system of measurement. You can use linear interpolation to find the VCF for values that are not listed in the tables[^2^].
  
After you find the VCF, you can multiply it by the volume at observed conditions to get the volume at reference conditions. Alternatively, you can divide the volume at reference conditions by the VCF to get the volume at observed conditions. You can also use the tables to find other conversion factors, such as density correction factor (DCF), pressure correction factor (PCF), or compressibility factor (CF), depending on your needs[^2^].
  
The Petroleum Measurement Tables (ASTM D 1250).pdf are a useful tool for calculating quantities of crude oil and petroleum products at reference conditions in different systems of measurement. They are based on rigorous mathematical expressions and standardized implementation procedures that ensure consistent and accurate results[^1^] [^2^].
